# Google Hash Code 2018

This is a repository for my solutions to the problem of online qualification round of Google Hash Code 2018.

I tried with two different algorithms:
- One is based on the distances specifically for the input "c\_no\_hurry.in".
- Other is based on the starting times specifically for the input "e\_high\_bonus.in".

The second algorithm turned out to perform better than the first one for the other inputs.

In the end, I got the following scores:
```
A - example [10 points - Sample]
B - should be easy [176.877 points - Algorithm2.py]
C - no hurry [15.754.803 points - Algorithm1.py]
D - metropolis [5.215.235 points - Algorithm2.py]
E - high bonus [21.424.663 points - Algorithm2.py]
Total [42.571.588 points - Ranked #997]
```
